# PDF Question Answering System Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This project is a sophisticated question-answering system designed to extract and provide context-aware answers from PDF documents. By integrating advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques and state-of-the-art AI models, the system enables users to interact with their documents in a more efficient and intelligent manner.

## Key Features

- **PDF Processing**: Upload and process PDF documents for analysis.
- **Interactive Q&A**: Enter natural-language questions and receive precise answers based on document content.
- **Advanced Retrieval**: Uses vector-based indexing and similarity scoring for accurate content retrieval.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A web application built with Streamlit ensures ease of use and accessibility.

## How It Works

1. **PDF Processing**:
   -  The system reads and processes the uploaded PDF, splitting it into manageable chunks for indexing.

3. **Information Retrieval**:
   - The indexed content is retrieved using advanced embeddings and similarity scoring.

4. **Answer Generation**:
   - A pre-trained language model generates context-aware and concise responses based on the retrieved content.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit for an interactive and intuitive user experience.
- **Backend**:
  - HuggingFace Transformers for natural language understanding and generation.
  - Vector-based retrieval using custom embeddings.
- **Programming Language**: Python.

## Code Overview

### `app.py`

- A Streamlit application that provides the user interface.
- Handles PDF uploads, question inputs, and displays answers.

### `rag.py`

- Implements the core RAG logic:
  - **PDF Processing**: Reads and splits the PDF into manageable chunks.
  - **Indexing**: Creates a vector index for efficient content retrieval.
  - **Query Engine**: Uses a retriever and postprocessor to answer queries.
  - **Response Generation**: Generates detailed responses using a transformer model.

## Usage Instructions

1. Upload a PDF file.
2. Wait for the system to process the document.
3. Type your question and click "Get Answer".
4. View the answer generated by the system.

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-Document Support**: Enable querying across multiple PDF files.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Add support for processing documents in multiple languages.
- **GPU Support**: Implement GPU acceleration for faster processing and response times.
- **Additional Formats**: Expand support to other document formats such as DOCX and TXT.
- **Enhanced UI**: Improve the user interface with advanced analytics and visualization features.
